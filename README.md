# **Landing Page Design**

Welcome to my landing page project! This repository contains a simple landing page that I created while learning web development through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). The primary focus of this project was to practice CSS Flexbox and basic HTML structuring.

## **Project Overview**

This landing page is a non-responsive design that showcases my current skills in using Flexbox for layout management. The page is static and focuses solely on the visual design without any interactive features or backend functionality.

## **Features**

- **Flexbox Layout**: The entire page layout is created using CSS Flexbox, demonstrating my understanding of this powerful layout module.
- **Basic Design**: The design is straightforward, focusing on clean structure and basic styling techniques.
- **Odin Project Exercise**: This project was developed as part of my learning process through The Odin Project.

## **Technologies Used**

- **HTML5**: The structure of the landing page is built using semantic HTML5 elements.
- **CSS3**: All styling, including layout, colors, and typography, is done using CSS3 with a focus on Flexbox.

## **Getting Started**

To view the landing page:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yash-govind/landing-page-css.git
   ```
2. **Open the index.html file** in your browser:
   - Navigate to the project folder.
   - Double-click on the `index.html` file to open it in your preferred web browser.

## **Future Improvements**

As I continue learning, I plan to:

- Make the design responsive to work on various screen sizes.
- Experiment with more advanced CSS techniques and layouts.
- Add JavaScript to introduce interactivity to the page.

## **Contributing**
